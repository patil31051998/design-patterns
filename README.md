## Creational design pattern
### Factory method
The factory design pattern says to define an interface ( A java interface or an abstract class) for creating the object and let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

### Abstract factory method
Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. It's a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Singleton
Singleton Pattern says that define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
